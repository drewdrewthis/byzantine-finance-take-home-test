# Take-Home Test Repository

Welcome to our take-home assessment! We’ve prepared two exercises to evaluate your front-end development, user experience design, and basic blockchain integration skills. These exercises are already included in a single Next.js codebase, split into two pages,one for each exercise.  
You’re free to be as creative as you like, and we encourage you to push the boundaries to create the best possible user experience.

## Exercises Overview

1. **Exercise 1: Vault Search Bar**  
   Build a search bar that filters a provided list of vaults within our Next.js boilerplate application. The table is already integrated, so you can focus entirely on the search functionality and user experience.
2. **Exercise 2: Vault Module (dApp)**  
   Transform a simple vault module (simulating ETH ↔ byzETH at a 1:1 ratio) into a fully functional dApp connected to the Holesky test network. The smart contract allows depositing ETH to mint byzETH and withdrawing byzETH to reclaim ETH, all at a 1:1 ratio.
